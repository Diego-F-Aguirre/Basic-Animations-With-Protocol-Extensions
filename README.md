Basic Animations
===================
 1. Show students the project so they can see what they will be building.
 2. Build your views in storyboard and make your subclasses for CustomImageView and CustomTextField, hook up your outlets and actions.
 3. Start with the CustomImageView. Setup the corner radius property as an IBInspectable property. Show how this affects what you can edit in storyboard. 
 4. Move to the CustomTextField file. Write out your method signatures and explain the toggling of the animations. 
 5. Write out the implementations of the methods. 
 6. Call the animation methods from the ViewController.swift file. 
 7. Make sure that all the students projects are working.
